Citi Bike Analysis using Tableau

**Background information:**
<br>I decided to use a timeframe in the peak of the COVID 19 pandemic. As such, I chose the April 2020 data set as it was much smaller than other months in 2020. The April 2020 data set was around 9,000 rows. The next smallest dataset for 2020 was around 11,500 rows for December of 2020. There was more ride data recorded in December of 2020 in the dead of winter than there was ride data recorded in April 2020, arguably one of the nicest weather months of the year. The largest data set for 2020 was September which had around 54,000 rows of data. I will be analyzing the April data set exclusively to see what type of bike rides people were taking in the peak of the pandemic.<br><br>
**Ride Information by User Type (Dashboard 1):**
<br>Subscribers are doing significantly more trips than regular customers. Regular customers are doing trips for a much longer duration than subscribers. I would have expected the subscribers to take longer trips if they enjoy the service enough to get a subscription for it.<br><br>
This may be occurring because the subscribers use the subscription to commute to work rather than using it as a leisure activity.<br><br> 
**Most Utilized Stations for Non-Subscribers (Dashboard 2):**<br>
For these measures I am excluding subscriber users. There are two ways to determine how profitable a station is to non-subscribing users. First, the number of rides that start from that station. Second, the duration of the rides that start from that station. 
<br><br>The starting stations with the greatest number of rides do not have the longest median ride durations. There are a few stations that have significantly longer ride durations than the busier stations however the volume of rides from these stations are much lower. 
<br><br>This phenomenon may be occurring because some of the higher volume stations are utilizing the bikes for utility purposes such as riding to the store. The higher ride duration stations may be utilizing the bikes more for sightseeing, tourism, and enjoyment purposes as opposed to accomplishing a specific task.<br><br> 
**Map:**<br>
From my analysis when making the map, the main trend I noticed was that there are a few top stations that make up the majority of the locations from which customers start or stop a trip. Popularity is definitely not consistent across all the stations and there are many more stations that are less popular than there are popular ones. There is a line of very popular stations right alongside the New York Bay by the water. The majority of the most popular points are very close together in a tight group of stations.
